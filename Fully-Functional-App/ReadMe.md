## 🎯 About the Project

This project is my **first fully functional Android application**, built in **Android Studio using Kotlin**. It consists of:

- ✅ **3-Page Navigation** using explicit and implicit intents
- 🎨 Use of **all major Android UI components**
- 🔄 Functional elements like **input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, spinners, switches, images, etc.**
- 📤 Multiple **implicit intents**: calling, web browsing, email, etc.
- ⚙️ Clean structure ideal for beginner-to-intermediate Android devs

> This project was part of my Android Development journey under GDSC and helped me gain confidence in building responsive, modular apps.
